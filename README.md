# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

The Parking Jam 3D Logic project is a simplified version of the Parking Jam 3D mobile game, implemented as a Python program using a 2D grid representation of cars, empty spaces, and barriers. Users can customize the grid size, the number of cars, and the placement of barriers, or choose from preset boards. The program leverages the Bauhaus Python library to generate random boards and analyze their state, determining whether they are in a winning state (where all cars can escape) or a losing state (where one or more cars are blocked by barriers). For winning boards, the program provides a step-by-step solution, showing cars exiting the grid one by one, dynamically updating and displaying the board after each move. This project demonstrates skills in logic-based problem-solving, algorithm design, and dynamic visualization.
